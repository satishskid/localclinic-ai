## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is my patient data safe?
**A:** Yes! The AI model runs entirely in your web browser. No data leaves your computer. Ever.

### Q: Why does it take time to load the first time?
**A:** The app downloads the AI model (~50MB) to your browser on first use. After that, it loads much faster and can even work offline.

### Q: Does this replace my clinical judgment?
**A:** No. This is a decision-support tool. Always verify AI suggestions against your professional expertise.

### Q: Can I use this on my phone?
**A:** The app works best on a laptop or desktop computer. Mobile support is limited.

### Q: What if the AI gives wrong information?
**A:** AI can make mistakes. Always verify critical findings. This tool is meant to assist, not replace, clinical judgment.

### Q: Do I need an internet connection?
**A:** Only for the first load. After the AI model is cached, the app works completely offline.
